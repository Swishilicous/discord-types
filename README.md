# Manual Discord Types (for Discord Client Mods)

Manually typing common discord webpack modules :)

Help would be greatly appreciated.

## Installation
```
npm i -D discord-types
```

## Intended Usage
```ts
import type { Constants } from 'discord-types/other';
import type { User, Message } from 'discord-types/general';
import type { GuildMemberStore } from 'discord-types/stores';
```

## Contributing
See [search_tools](https://github.com/Swishilicous/discord-types/blob/main/search_tools.md) for tools to find types.
